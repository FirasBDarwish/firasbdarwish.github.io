## 📝 Abstract
<div class="p-4 bg-light rounded shadow-sm mb-4" markdown="1">
The physical design of upper-limb prosthetic devices has advanced rapidly to allow for very refined high Degree of Freedom (DoF) control. However, control strategies for these prostheses remain unsatisfactory—with long training periods and high rejection rates—preventing prosthetic users from achieving their devices’ full potential.  

We propose an **intuitive, reliable, transradial prosthetic control strategy** that combines **computer vision grasp detection** with **sEMG signal analysis**, fused in real time. This approach reduces training time, improves reliability, and enhances intuitiveness.
