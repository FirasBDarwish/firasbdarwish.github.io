## üìù Abstract
<div class="p-4 bg-light rounded shadow-sm mb-4" markdown="1">
In this report, we demonstrate the various design choices and techniques used in the process of
building a **music classification model based on data extracted using Spotify‚Äôs API**.

1. We first describe all pre-processing decisions made (normalization, handling missing data, one-hot
encoding, etc.); as these pre-processing techniques are used repeatedly across all models that we
build and present, we segment this into its own introductory section.
2. We present the working of building a series of classification models using all the remaining features and
evaluating the success of these models.
3. We repeat this process, this time adding a relevant dimensionality reduction technique and extracting key insights by clustering our data in the low dimensional space. Finally, we exhibit any additional and supplementary observations that came out during this exploration.
